We're Hiring A Web Designer & Developer - WebDev
If you've got talent burning a hole in your pocket, wishing your job really made use of ALL your skills, you might be just the person I'm looking for.

Who am I?
I own a small web design and marketing company on the rise, growing and expanding our client base, services and processes. We help small businesses and start ups with everything they do online from their websites to social media, to SEO, newsletters and more. We also do branding and the occasional print job. I'm still learning how to manage it all, and I think you are a key part of the solution.

Our projects range from brand new, small and large, to small text changes on an existing website, to social media management, to campaign ideas, to lead generation and search engine optimization, logo design and brand creation.

A few questions, if I may...

     Are you a Type A and proud of it?
     Do you only turn in your work when you think it has hit perfection?
     Do you question the reason behind the request?
     Do you love learning new platforms and programs, as long as they work?
     Are you the one that friends go to for help, when their shortcut didn't work?
     Can you wear multiple hats and jump in where and when needed?
     Do you absolutely love helping people?
     Do you love creating something that gets an emotional reaction out of people?


I'm looking for a Web Designer and Developer to help create the highest quality designs and experiences for all the exciting new internal and external projects with my company... not just this year, but beyond.

This is a contract / part-time position with the expectation of growing into full-time. An honest-to-goodness awesome opportunity that, it just so happens, you can do from anywhere.

I don't need you to know every single thing about building a website or creating a marketing strategy. But I do need you to have a solid understanding of how websites and online marketing work, including building websites, updating websites, lead magnets, opt-in pages, sales pages, email marketing processes, webinars, Facebook marketing, etc. (If any of those phrases are brand new to you, this likely is not the perfect position for you.)

I need you to make sure that our high standards stay consistent and reliable, from start to finish, with each project we put out.

I'll be straight with you: This position has high expectations.

But if you're the person I'm looking for, you're the type who gets motivated by high expectations.

Thinking this gig is tailor-made for you? Read on to learn more.

The Role:

     The WebDevs in our company are expected to design home pages that inspire and wow a visitor. They should never look like a template that anyone can buy. Our creativity must shine through.
     The WebDevs are expected to design secondary pages within the browser to save time and be more efficient. These pages are inspired by the home page design and brand guidelines.
     The WebDev must think through the goals the client wants to achieve, to create an experience that speaks to their target audience. Challenge ideas that don't make sense or could be improved upon.
     The WebDev must know about usability and ease of use. It is very important to us that each site we build is easy to use on the backend by our clients and easy to use on the front end by their visitors.
     The WebDev must QA their own work before handing it over to a project manager for review. Check that all the parts of a request are accounted for and that everything looks good across multiple devices and screen sizes.
     The WebDev must ask questions when things are confusing or incomplete. And say ""no"" when you are overloaded with work or life.
     The WebDev must design clean code that is easy to read and comprehend. Any other teammate should be able to pick up where you left off.
     The WebDev should always give feedback and help us improve our processes and make things more efficient as we grow and learn.
     The WebDev must be interested in continuing education and staying on top of the latest web trends. And sharing this knowledge with the team.
     The WebDev must be a good team player, staying positive, giving constructive feedback, and supporting team members.
     The WebDev on our team love to be challenged and pushed to do their best.
     The WebDev work on small ongoing projects as well as large new projects. Sometimes we do a simple text change or sometimes we're adding a new feature.
     The WebDev know WordPress inside and out because most of our sites are built on the platform.


Here's who this position is NOT for:

     Those looking for a ""side job"" while growing their own business, then this isn't for you.
     People who have a lot going on already, and don't have the time and focus needed to create quality work.
     The people who haven't read a non-fiction book (or podcast or blog) about business, websites, marketing in a very long time.
     Those who aren't willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
     People who don't share well with others.
     Those who have a full time job and no freelance experience.


However, this position IS for a person who:

     Is resourceful.
     Can handle stress and tight deadlines.
     Is able to wear multiple hats within a small company setting.
     Works very well with other people and can build rapport quickly with both team members and clients.
     Has great attention to detail and design quality.
     Is not locked into just working 9-5 but embraces a ""until it gets done"" attitude. (You also don't have to work those hours specifically, our team is all over the board. But you do need to be available for a reasonable chunk of time between 9am to 6pm PST)
     Is a high-functioning communicator.
     Is organized.
     Takes ownership and pride in their work.
     Owns mistakes, learns from them and grows.
     Is not afraid of new challenges.
     Will tackle a small text change and treat like a large project - QA-ing and double checking work.
     Loves learning new things and can implement new ideas quickly.
     Adapts really well to changes on-the-go.
     Can handle direct & blunt feedback.
     Can juggle lots of moving pieces while staying collected.
     Is honest, trustworthy and full of integrity.
     Loves to have fun doing their job!


Here's what the right person willloveabout this position:

     You'll be paid to do what you already get a kick out of, learning new ways to make things work.
     You'll get to do your work from anywhere: your living room, the coffee shop, a hotel pool, a blanket fort...
     You'll get to work in a fast-growing web design and marketing company, where there are loads of growth opportunities (both right now and in the future).
     You'll get to help a small company grow, set expectations and standards, and steer the general direction we're going in.
     You'll be part of a company that has one main goal: Helping people get more of what they want out of life. By helping people create successful businesses we help them to create successful lives.


Sound like what you've been looking for? Read this before continuing...
The goal of this survey is to give you the opportunity to share insights into your skills and experience while keeping brevity in mind. (We will receive hundreds of surveys, so I'll appreciate your brevity more than you know!) The key is to stand out with your content, not its length. I am looking forward to getting to know you.

     Do you have experience working with project managers and the other members of a virtual, technical team? If yes, briefly tell me about it.

Instructors need to have programming experience in the languages taught. Good communication skills with parents is helpful, but more important is communicating well with the kids.

Starting part-time pay is $20 - $25 per hour for lead instructors, $16.50 per hour for assistant instructors. Assistant instructors will generally be paired with another instructor, where a lead instructor can run their own small classes. Most classes are after school (3:00 pm - 7:30 pm) or Saturdays (9 am - 1 pm).

While the instructors need to be reliable, there can be some flexibility to the scheduling. Ideally, we find days and sets of classes an instructor can commit to and hold to these with minimal week-to-week schedule variance.

Because instructors work closely with children, we do conduct background checks.
